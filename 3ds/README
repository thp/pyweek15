Conversion from 3dsx to cia contributed by zoogie_gba @ reddit.

Directions:
 - 3dsx: copy the 3ds and onewhaletrip folder to the root of the sd
 - cia: copy the cia and onewhaletrip folder to root of sd and
         install the cia with FBI/devmenu

Known Issues:

 - rather sluggish on old3ds (cia/3dsx) and new3ds (just 3dsx).
 - pressing home on new3ds cia version hangs. use start to exit.
 - slow boot up
